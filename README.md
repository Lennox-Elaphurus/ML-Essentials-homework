## Repository guidelines

I (Lennox) recommend following guidelines to keep our repo clean and conflict-free.

- Store our private files in the folder named by our names
- Put the code we need to cooperate(public files) in the root folder
- Whenever we need to make changes (including private and public files), create a new branch. Do the changes. Then merge the branch when the change is finished.
